# learning_dynamical_systems

This repo uses [ds-opt](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt) to explore transfer learning between dynamical systems datasets. 

## To-do:
- [ ] Check instances of `Data` in `demo_learn_lpvDS_mod.m`; they may need to be replaced with `Xi_ref`?
- [ ] Make user_input loop until a valid input is received
